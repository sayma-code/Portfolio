            I build what interest me. I just started my journey after completing
            my graduation in 2020. I worked as a full-stack developer for a
            company. Now I work on completion based projects. I work on both the
            front-end and the back-end. Have a basic understanding of digital
            design. And I enjoy painting.{" "}
