                it's awesome to meet you! ðŸŒŸ. My
                adventure into technology began when I successfully completed my
                degree in 2020. I began as a full-stack developer and have
                subsequently shifted my focus to completion-based projects. My
                expertise spans both the front and back ends, allowing me to
                create seamless digital experiences. Beyond the intricacies of
                code, I possess a fundamental understanding of digital design.
                However, my passion doesn't stop thereâ€”outside the digital
                world, I find joy in the art of painting. My paintings echo my
                enthusiasm for freedom in creativity and self-expression. That's
                a lot of embarrassing talks. Thanks for dropping by my website!
                I'm excited to share more of my story with you.
