                  It's awesome to meet you! <span role="img" aria-label="star">&#127775;</span>. My adventure into technology
                  began when I successfully completed my degree in<span> 2020</span>. I began
                  as a <span>full-stack developer</span> full-stack developer and have subsequently shifted my
                  focus to <span>completion-based projects</span><span role="img" aria-label="computer_image">&#128187;</span>. My expertise spans both
                  the front and back ends, allowing me to create seamless
                  digital experiences. Beyond the intricacies of code, I have a fundamental understanding of <span>digital design. </span>. However, my

                  joy in the art of painting<span role="img" aria-label="paintings">&#127750;</span>. My paintings echo my enthusiasm
                  for freedom in creativity and self-expression. That's a lot of

                  excited to share more of my story with you.
